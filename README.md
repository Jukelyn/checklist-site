# Templists

Templists is a modern take on the classic checklist. It's designed for those moments when you need a quick list -- without the hassle of managing or organizing them long term. Unlike many bloated or overly styled alternatives, Templists keeps things fast, minimal, and intuitive. Create checklists on the fly, use them, and forget them. Or, if you prefer, save them for later.

Key Features:

- Choose from three layouts: a classic list view, a grid view, or a Pinterest-style masonry layout.
- Clean, minimalist interface.
- Easily set and edit list titles and items.
- Delete lists or individual items with ease.
- Search through your saved lists.
- Export your lists when needed.
