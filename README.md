# Templists

Templists are just temporary checklists. I find myself need a checklist but I don't want to deal with keep them and I also don't like the look or bloat that a lot of other solutions offer. Templists are temporary checklists that you can allow to persist but are usually gone upon a refresh. A history of templists are stored, just in case.
